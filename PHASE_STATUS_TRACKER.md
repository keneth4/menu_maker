## Phase 0 checklist
- [x] Create a phase tracker with status board.
- [x] Create a parity contract document with acceptance criteria.
- [x] Build drift inventory from current duplicated preview/export runtime logic.
- [x] Define the first extraction slice into shared runtime module(s).
- [x] Implement shared helper module(s) and consume from preview + export builders.
- [x] Add parity e2e spec for preview vs exported-site behavior.
- [x] Wire parity spec as a required gate before feature phases merge.

First extraction slice selected:
- `PHASE0_EXTRACTION_SLICE_01.md`
- Focus: shared image source policy (`srcset`, carousel source, detail source, derivative fallback order).

Implemented:
- New shared module: `src/export-runtime/imageSources.ts`
- Preview now consumes shared helpers via `src/App.svelte`.
- Export runtime helper block is now generated from shared policy via `buildExportRuntimeImageSourceHelpers()`.
- Unit coverage added in `src/export-runtime/imageSources.test.ts`.
- Parity e2e added: `tests/e2e/parity-image-sources.spec.ts`.

Current parity run command:
- `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/parity-image-sources.spec.ts`
- Required gate command: `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/parity-image-sources.spec.ts`

## Asset derivative requirement (added 2026-02-09)
Upload/import processing must generate fixed-size derived assets and keep originals.

Contract:
- Keep originals under `assets/originals/**`.
- Keep resized variants under `assets/derived/**`.
- Save project zips include originals only.
- Export zips include derived startup assets plus originals required for detail rendering.
- Backgrounds use common-screen fixed resolutions (`1280x720`, `1920x1080`) with `cover` fit.
- Dishes use square fixed resolutions (`512x512`, `768x768`) with transparent `contain` fit.
- Derivatives are generated through an `ffmpeg` processing pipeline (animation + alpha preserved).
- Preferred derived delivery format is animated `webp` (optional gif fallback profile).

Tracking checklist:
- [x] Schema + normalization for originals/derived metadata and profile versioning.
- [x] Bridge preprocessing pipeline for animated and transparent assets (`ffmpeg`) during save/export.
- [x] Ensure `ffmpeg` is available in local + container execution paths.
- [x] Preview/export source selection switched to derived variants.
- [x] Save packaging includes originals only + strips derived metadata from `menu.json`.
- [x] Export packaging includes derived startup assets + originals for detail rendering with rewrite validation.
- [x] Bridge export integration fixture validates packaging contract with transparent GIF input.
- [ ] Test coverage for animated-alpha inputs and packaging contracts.

## Drift inventory (2026-02-09)
| Priority | Hotspot | Preview runtime location | Export runtime location | Drift impact | Candidate shared module |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Template interaction constants + wheel/touch normalization | `src/core/templates/registry.ts`, `src/core/templates/strategies/*`, `src/App.svelte` | `src/App.svelte` (`buildExportScript` constants + handlers) | Template navigation behavior can diverge between preview and exported site. | `src/export-runtime/templateInteraction.ts` |
| P0 | Interactive modal media decode/render pipeline | `src/App.svelte` (`setupInteractiveDetailMedia`) | `src/App.svelte` (`setupInteractiveModalMedia` inside export script) | 360 media behavior/fallbacks can drift and cause modal mismatch. | `src/export-runtime/interactiveMedia.ts` |
| P0 | Modal lifecycle and rotation-state handling | `src/App.svelte` (`openDish`/`closeDish`) + `src/ui/components/DishModal.svelte` | `src/App.svelte` (`bindCards` + `closeModal`) | Open/close semantics and rotation behavior can diverge quickly. | `src/export-runtime/modalController.ts` |
| P1 | Image source policy (`srcset`, carousel source, detail source) | `src/App.svelte` (`buildResponsiveSrcSetFromMedia`, `getCarouselImageSource`, `getDetailImageSource`) | `src/App.svelte` (`buildSrcSet`, `getCarouselImageSrc`, `getDetailImageSrc`) | Different image sizes loaded in preview vs export affects UX/perf parity. | `src/export-runtime/imageSources.ts` |
| P1 | Startup preload plan and blocking/deferred strategy | `src/App.svelte` (`collectPreviewStartupPlan`, `preloadPreviewStartupAssets`) + `src/core/menu/startupAssets.ts` | `src/App.svelte` (`preloadStartupAssets`) | First-view loading and perceived speed can diverge. | `src/export-runtime/startupPreload.ts` |
| P1 | Locale/allergen/price formatting helpers | `src/App.svelte` (`textOf`, `getAllergenValues`, `formatPrice`) + `src/core/menu/*` | `src/App.svelte` (export runtime helper copies) | Text fallback and price rendering can mismatch in edge locales. | `src/export-runtime/localization.ts` |
| P2 | Preview DOM/template render structure | `src/ui/components/PreviewCanvas.svelte` | `src/App.svelte` (HTML template string in export runtime render) | UI-level changes can be applied to preview but missed in export render. | `src/export-runtime/renderTemplates.ts` |
| P2 | Event wiring + cleanup lifecycle | Svelte lifecycle + handler bindings in `src/App.svelte` | Imperative DOM bindings in export runtime string | Lifecycle regressions may appear only in one runtime. | `src/export-runtime/events.ts` |

## Session log
### 2026-02-09
- Initialized phase tracking.
- Marked Phase 0 as active.
- Added references in `SAFE_FIRST_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` to tracker and parity contract docs.
- Added prioritized preview/export drift inventory for parity extraction planning.
- Added asset-derivative requirement and packaging rules to roadmap tracking.
- Selected first Phase-0 extraction slice and documented scope/acceptance criteria.
- Implemented extraction slice 01 (shared image source policy) and validated with targeted tests + build.
- Added and validated parity e2e spec for shared image source policy (preview vs exported runtime).
- Wired parity spec as explicit required gate command path in phase gates.
- Closed Phase 0 and moved active work to Phase 1.
- Implemented Phase 1 schema + normalization defaults for identity/logo, dish rotation, and original/derived metadata fields.
- Implemented Phase 1 save-zip asset collection + rewriting for logo/original/derived/responsive paths, with tests.
- Implemented identity/logo parity in preview + export runtime topbar rendering.
- Added editor + wizard controls for identity mode/logo source and dish rotation direction metadata.
- Removed modal rotate-toggle UI and switched rotation behavior to dish-level `rotationDirection` in preview + exported runtime.
- Updated static export asset collection/rewrite to include logo asset paths.
- Added desktop keyboard controls (`Arrow*` navigation + `Escape` close) in preview and exported runtime.
- Corrected cw/ccw mapping behavior and switched direction control to a compact toggle below the 360 source input.
- Enforced derived-only export asset collection (excluding originals when derived variants are available).
- Updated exported `menu.json` rewrite flow to remap `derived` + `responsive` paths and drop `originalSrc`/`originalHero360`.
- Added export packaging unit coverage for derived-only source collection.
- Added shared centered-fit helpers for contain padding and cover cropping, including centered ffmpeg filter templates (`(ow-iw)/2`, `(iw-ow)/2`).
- Switched in-app generated responsive variants to centered contain placement to enforce symmetric composition.
- Added bridge ffmpeg preprocessing endpoint (`/api/assets/prepare-derived`) that generates centered background/item derivatives and rewrites project media metadata before export.
- Export flow in bridge mode now calls derived preprocessing before packaging, preventing original-asset fallback when derivatives can be generated.
- Added ffmpeg installation to container images (`Dockerfile.dev`, `Dockerfile.prod` build stage).
- Save flow in bridge mode now runs the same ffmpeg preprocessing before persisting `menu.json` and generating the save zip.
- Added bridge client regression coverage for `/prepare-derived` request/response/error contract.
- Added save/export workflow progress UI with step-by-step status and percentage updates, including a dedicated derived-media processing stage.
- Added bridge e2e integration fixture (`tests/e2e/ffmpeg-derived-export.spec.ts`) that validates static export zips contain derived assets and exclude originals.
- Improved long-running progress behavior so derived-processing stages keep advancing visibly (decimal progress and higher cap).
- Added ZIP-import upload progress workflow (parse/upload/apply) when opening a project from zip in bridge mode.
- ZIP-import in bridge mode now triggers derived-asset preparation after upload, so first export can reuse prebuilt variants.
- Optimized bridge derivation reuse checks and switched dish derivatives to webp-only output profile to avoid long gif fallback transcodes and export timeouts.
- ZIP-import now completes without waiting for full derivation (runs background prep), and save/export reuse the same in-flight derivation task to prevent duplicate ffmpeg work.
- Stabilized derivation naming when source files already live under `originals/**` to prevent recursive re-derivation loops across repeated exports.
- Increased ffmpeg command timeout budget to reduce false timeouts on large animated source assets.
- Tuned ffmpeg derivation profile for throughput by capping animation FPS (`items: 24`, `backgrounds: 18`) and reducing libwebp compression level (`6 -> 4`) to avoid long-running export/import stalls.
- Hardened bridge-derived processing so a single corrupt/unreadable source asset no longer aborts save/export; failed assets now log a warning and continue with the original reference.
- Updated bridge fallback to materialize `originals/**` plus `derived/**` copy-variants when ffmpeg cannot decode an asset, so save/export packaging remains consistent and does not leak original-path references.
- Disabled in-browser responsive resizing for `image/webp` hero assets during static export bundling to prevent animated-frame compositing artifacts in hosted exports.
- Strengthened item-derivative profile for quality/perf parity: medium dish variants are now still-frame `webp` (lighter carousel), large variants remain animated for detail interaction, and alpha handling was tightened with `format=rgba` + `alpha_quality=100`.
- Simplified interactive modal frame normalization to rely on browser-decoded complete frames and avoid manual `visibleRect` recomposition artifacts (ghost/onion edges).
- Added e2e regression coverage for bridge save zips to assert originals + derived packaging contract after ffmpeg preprocessing/fallback (`tests/e2e/ffmpeg-derived-export.spec.ts`).
- Updated derivative reuse rules and bumped active derivative profile IDs (`ffmpeg-v4-*`) to regenerate legacy/stale media once, ensuring projects pick up the latest sizing/alpha/perf profile fixes.

### 2026-02-10
- Refined Phase 4 asset strategy: preview/startup now consumes reduced derived media while detail-card media resolves to `originalHero360` on demand.
- Changed derived generation targets to smaller mirrors (backgrounds scaled to ~50%; dishes to single reduced preview variant) and updated active derivative profile IDs (`ffmpeg-v5-background-half-webp`, `ffmpeg-v7-item-md-webp-detail-original`) for one-time regeneration.
- Restricted user asset management scope to `assets/originals/backgrounds/**` and `assets/originals/items/**`; `derived/**` is now hidden from asset manager operations.
- Added guardrails to prevent rename/move/delete of base managed roots and to reject path traversal/out-of-scope operations.
- Updated export packaging/runtime contract so static export includes `originals/items/**` for detail rendering while still avoiding `originals/backgrounds/**`.
- Fixed bridge derivative reuse staleness checks so existing derived assets are only reused when they are newer than originals; re-uploaded originals now force regeneration on the next derive run.
- ZIP open flow in bridge mode now waits for `prepare-derived` during upload workflow (with progress), instead of deferring derivation silently in the background.
- Assets tab now uses icon-based top/file actions and includes an in-panel progress bar that shows upload + derived-processing status for manual asset uploads.
- Bumped dish derivative profile id to `ffmpeg-v6-item-contain-md-webp-lg-gif` so previously generated dish derivatives are reprocessed once under the latest pipeline.

### 2026-02-11
- Removed visible white/gray placeholder blocks while dish media streams in by switching to a transparent placeholder source.
- Added per-card carousel loading spinner state in both preview and exported runtime so unresolved media shows an intentional loading affordance instead of an empty square.
- Added per-source media readiness tracking in preview (`category + item + source`) to avoid stale loaded-state reuse when item media source paths change.
- Removed unsupported ffmpeg `-alpha_quality` flag from derive pipeline to avoid container runtime failures (`Unrecognized option 'alpha_quality'`).
- Resolved dev-console Svelte a11y warnings in `App.svelte`, `DishModal.svelte`, and `AssetsManager.svelte` by using semantic interactive elements/roles.
- Updated parity e2e to validate current source policy (derived carousel/background + original detail) and placeholder-aware source reading.
- Synced roadmap/docs to implemented save/export contract and marked Phase 6 complete.

  - moved monolithic builder implementation to `src/export-runtime/fragments/runtimeScriptComposer.ts`,
  - `src/export-runtime/buildRuntimeScript.ts` now stays at `12` lines and preserves API contract.
- Upgraded architecture guardrails:
  - `src/App.architecture.test.ts` now enforces line budgets for `App.svelte`, `AppRuntime.svelte`, and `buildRuntimeScript.ts`,
  - added guard asserting `createAppController` actions perform real state mutations (no no-op behavior).
- Reworked `src/ui/controllers/createAppController.ts` from no-op actions to real store-backed action groups:
  - shell/project/asset/preview/workflow/modal actions now mutate typed stores,
  - controller `mount()` now hydrates initial project state,
  - controller `destroy()` keeps lifecycle cleanup ownership explicit.
- Expanded state contract/store coverage for runtime ownership alignment:
  - `src/ui/contracts/state.ts` now includes wizard/project list and asset bridge/session fields,
  - updated defaults in `src/ui/stores/projectStore.ts`, `src/ui/stores/shellStore.ts`, and `src/ui/stores/assetStore.ts`.
- Added unit coverage for closeout guardrails and wiring:
  - `src/ui/controllers/createAppController.test.ts`,
  - `src/ui/stores/storeSlices.test.ts`,
  - `src/export-runtime/buildRuntimeScript.test.ts`.
- Container-first gate path wiring updates:
  - added scripts `test:e2e:local`, `test:e2e:container`, and `test:perf:container` in `package.json`,
  - `npm run test:e2e` and `npm run test:perf` now use container-first wrappers with local fallback,
  - updated `scripts/test-e2e.sh`, `scripts/test-perf.sh`, `scripts/container-smoke.sh`, and `docker-compose.yml` to support optional `E2E_GREP` control.
- Documentation sync for architecture and gate policy:
  - updated `README.md` technical notes and command references for wrapper/screen split and container-first gates,
  - updated `APP_REDISTRIBUTION_REVIEWER_GUIDE.md` mapping for `AppRuntimeScreen` and real `createAppController` action wiring.
- Current gate status after closeout-pass implementation:
  - `npm run build`: PASS
  - `npm test`: PASS
  - `npm run test:e2e`: PASS in container-first mode (`22 passed`, `3 skipped`, `0 failed`).
  - `npm run test:perf`: PASS in container-first mode (`performance-fluidity` spec).
- Remaining redistribution hotspot after wrapper split:
  - `src/ui/components/AppRuntimeScreen.svelte` still carries 1894 lines of orchestration and needs further extraction before declaring full redistribution completion quality.
- Hardened container gate semantics for strict closeout:
  - `scripts/container-smoke.sh` now treats empty `E2E_GREP` as full suite (no implicit smoke-only fallback).
  - `scripts/test-e2e.sh` now passes through unset/empty `E2E_GREP` correctly to container runner.
  - `scripts/test-perf.sh` now targets `performance smoke keeps startup and modal interaction responsive`.
  - `scripts/test-e2e.sh` and `scripts/test-perf.sh` now default `ALLOW_CONTAINER_BUILD=1` for clean-machine reliability (override still supported).
  - `package.json` `test:perf:container` now explicitly runs the perf spec in container.
- Gate verification in expected container-first path:
  - `npm run test:e2e`: PASS (container-first full suite, `22 passed`, `3 skipped`).
  - `npm run test:perf`: PASS (container-first perf spec).
  - `npm run test:e2e:container`: PASS (forced full containerized e2e).

  - Added runtime composition module:
    - `src/ui/controllers/runtimeWiringController.ts`
    - `src/ui/controllers/runtimeWiringController.test.ts`
  - Rewired `src/ui/components/AppRuntimeScreenContent.svelte` to:

    - removed top header toggle-view button in `src/ui/components/EditorShell.svelte` and runtime wiring callsites,
    - enforced Jukebox wheel axis routing (`vertical -> cards`, `horizontal -> sections`) in `src/ui/controllers/runtimePreviewAdapterController.ts`,
    - preserved detail-card original image priority while stabilizing inline source normalization in `src/application/projects/presentationWorkflow.ts`.
  - Fixed import/background/assets parity for no-bridge zip opens:

    - `src/App.svelte`: `16`
    - `src/ui/components/AppRuntime.svelte`: `8`

- Phase 9.1 recovery follow-up pass (background visibility + section-mode parity stabilization):
  - Fixed section-mode preview background orchestration race:
    - `src/ui/controllers/previewBackgroundController.ts` now preserves `-1` for invalid section mappings (no fallback) and separates project-sync behavior from active-index loading behavior.
    - `src/ui/components/AppRuntimeScreenContent.svelte` now splits project/background sync and active-index loaded-background sync reactive blocks to avoid section-nav overwrite loops.
  - Fixed export-runtime section background settle race:
    - `src/export-runtime/fragments/runtimeScriptComposer.ts` jukebox scroll handler no longer re-syncs section background mid-scroll; background sync occurs on settle to prevent active-section flapping.
  - Added/updated targeted regression coverage:
    - `src/ui/controllers/previewBackgroundController.test.ts` (invalid-mapping no-fallback guard).
    - Existing parity specs validated in container mode:
      - `tests/e2e/parity-section-background.spec.ts`
      - `tests/e2e/import-parity.spec.ts`
      - `tests/e2e/detail-image-source-parity.spec.ts`

    - `npm run test:perf`: PASS (container-first perf spec: `1 passed`)
- Phase 9.2 recovery follow-up pass (locale switching + Jukebox focus/scroll parity):
  - Added targeted regression coverage for reported parity gaps:
    - extended `tests/e2e/app.spec.ts` with locale dropdown and desktop section-nav button checks for Jukebox preview.
    - strengthened `tests/e2e/jukebox-scroll-parity.spec.ts` to assert no section recoil to index `0` during center-screen horizontal gestures.
    - added `tests/e2e/jukebox-import-reactivity.spec.ts` for JSON/ZIP import reactivity parity (section + item responsiveness).
  - Added controller/component unit coverage for restored behavior contracts:
    - `src/ui/components/PreviewCanvas.test.ts`
    - `src/ui/controllers/previewController.test.ts`
    - `src/ui/controllers/previewNavigationController.test.ts`
    - `src/ui/controllers/runtimePreviewAdapterController.test.ts`
  - Fixed locale propagation overwrite race:
    - `src/ui/components/PreviewCanvas.svelte` now guards pending local locale commits so model sync no longer clobbers user selection on the same tick.
  - Restored pre-refactor horizontal settle/focus behavior:
    - `src/ui/controllers/previewController.ts` now performs horizontal focused-section sync, schedules settle snap, and confirms section focus after settle.
    - `src/ui/controllers/runtimePreviewAdapterController.ts` removed custom horizontal section-lock interception and defers to carousel/native menu-scroll behavior.
    - `src/ui/controllers/previewNavigationController.ts` now exposes hysteresis-stable horizontal section resolution to prevent midpoint flapping.
  - Gate status after this follow-up:
    - `npm run build`: PASS
    - `npm test`: PASS (`59` files, `154` tests)
    - `npm run test:e2e`: PASS (container-first full suite: `33 passed`, `3 skipped`)
    - `npm run test:perf`: PASS (container-first perf spec: `1 passed`)
- Phase 9.4 recovery follow-up pass (template-switch coherence + desktop wheel/section parity):
  - Unified Project-tab template switching through controller action pipeline:
    - `src/ui/components/ProjectInfoPanel.svelte` now dispatches `actions.setTemplate(...)` instead of direct draft mutation.
    - `src/ui/components/RuntimeEditorTabContent.svelte` now routes template changes to `editorDraftController.applyTemplate(templateId, { source: "project" })`.
    - `src/ui/contracts/components.ts` now includes `ProjectInfoPanelActions.setTemplate`.
  - Added Wizard showcase eligibility guardrail and wiring:
    - new workflow `src/application/projects/wizardShowcaseEligibility.ts` + unit test.
    - `src/ui/controllers/editorDraftController.ts` now gates wizard demo/showcase activation by blank-project eligibility.
    - `src/ui/components/AppRuntimeScreenContent.svelte` now clears stale showcase state when current draft becomes ineligible.
  - Hardened Jukebox desktop wheel/section behavior and template compatibility:
    - `src/ui/controllers/runtimePreviewAdapterController.ts` now uses deterministic desktop horizontal-intent routing for section changes while preserving vertical carousel movement.
    - `src/ui/components/PreviewCanvasLegacy.svelte` now enforces desktop-only section-nav rendering.
    - `src/export-runtime/fragments/runtimeScriptComposer.ts` now mirrors desktop-only section-nav contract in export runtime.
    - `src/core/templates/registry.ts` + `src/core/menu/normalization.ts` now canonicalize template IDs with alias normalization.
  - Stabilized e2e harness and flaky parity/perf edges:
    - Open-project helpers now use deterministic hidden-input upload path across e2e specs.
    - `tests/e2e/interactive-modal.spec.ts` now uses a deterministic GIF-data fixture to validate interactive modal rendering.
    - `tests/e2e/parity-section-background.spec.ts` settle-window polling widened for container stability.
    - `tests/e2e/performance-fluidity.spec.ts` now uses percentile-based frame jitter assertions (`p95`/`p99`) to reduce container noise while keeping responsiveness gates.
  - Final line-count checkpoint:
    - `src/ui/components/AppRuntimeScreenContent.svelte`: `898` lines (architecture cap `<= 900`).
  - Gate status after this follow-up:
    - `npm run build`: PASS
